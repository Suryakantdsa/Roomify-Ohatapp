# Roomify

Roomify is a real-time chat application designed for seamless communication using WebSockets. It allows users to create rooms, chat within rooms, and send direct messages to other users. This project is built using a Turborepo for monorepo management and utilizes `pnpm` as the package manager.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following packages:

- **ws-backend**: WebSocket server for real-time messaging.
- **http-backend**: HTTP server for REST API services.
- **react-frontend**: React-based frontend for the chat application.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)
